# ReadmeTester

Tests code in readme files, generates the readme if they are successful.

## TODO

* uh... make this a real readme
* release as gem
* extract magic_comments and rspec out into their own gems
* set up input files so they don't need a .mountain_berry_fields in their name if given a -o flag
