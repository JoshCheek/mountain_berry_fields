# ReadmeTester

Tests code in readme files, generates the readme if they are successful.

## TODO

* uh... make this a real readme
* erb shouldn't render the fuckign code in a visible block, there should just be commands, they should always be invisible Then the evaluator can decide what it wants to make visible and invisible by appending to the document
* add support for real tests (rspec)
* add support for contexts
* add support for file rendering and line numbers
* rename strategy to something not so fucking snooty
